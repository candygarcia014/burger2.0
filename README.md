# Eat-Da-Burger/ burger2.0

## Description
Eat-Da-Burger is an app that lets the user know which hamburgers have already been eaten and which hamburgers are available to eat. it also allows the user to input their own hamburger name and determine if it has already been eaten or not. 
 
The burgers at the top of the page are available to be eaten. 
The burgers in the middle section of the page have already been devoured. 
The last section of the page lets the user enter their own burger name and the eaten state of the burger. 
 
If the burgers from the "available to eat" section get eaten then they will move to the "already devoured‚Äù section (second section of the page).
