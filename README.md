# Eat-Da-Burger/ burger2.0

## Description
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be eaten. Each burger in the waiting area also has an "EAT!"  button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the bottom side of the page. Eaten burgers on the bottom of the page will have an "I WANT MORE!" button which will return that burger to the top of the page so it can be eaten again.
