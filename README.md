# Eat-Da-Burger/ burger2.0

## Description
Eat-Da-Burger! is an app that lets the user know which hamburgers have already been eaten and which hamburgers are avilable to eat. it also allows the user to input their own hambrge name and determine if it has already been eaten or not. 

When a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be eaten. 

The burrgers at the top of the page are avaiable to be eaten. 
The burgers in the middle section of the page have already been devoured. 
The last section of the page lets the user enter thir own butger name and the eaten state of the burger. 

If the burgers from the "avaiable to eat" section get eaten then they will move to the "already devoured section (second section of the page).
